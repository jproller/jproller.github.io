During the 2020-21 school year, I served as the payload self-righting and stabilization lead for the High Power Rocketry Club's robotic lander payload as part of NASA's University Student Launch Initiative.

In my freshman year at WPI, I joined the Payload Division of the school’s High Power Rocketry Club which takes part in NASA’s University Student Launch Initiative competition each year. Although I knew very little about CAD (let alone almost nothing about SolidWorks), I was able to learn quickly by working on the design for the subscale mockup of that year’s payload retention system. I designed the sled-pusher system which served to push the payload sled, where the UAV payload would sit during launch, out of the rocket’s airframe once it successfully landed on the ground under parachute. The main mechanism was a leadscrew coupled to a motor, which was used to produce the linear motion necessary for the pusher system. Once the design was finished and reviewed, we went on to prototype the system with mostly laser cut plywood plates and a few 3D printed plastic parts. The subscale retention system was tested and found to work mostly as desired and after that, I helped with designing the full-scale version. In the full-scale version, I worked mostly on the driver system which was responsible for interfacing the motor and the leadscrew, along with housing most of the payload electronics. Below is a photo of the fully assembled payload retention system for the full-scale vehicle.
